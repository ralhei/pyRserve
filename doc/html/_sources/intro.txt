pyRserve
=========

What It Does
-------------

pyRerve is a library for connecting Python to an `R process <http://www.r-project.org/>`_ (an excellent statistic package) running `Rserve <http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/>`_ as a RPC connection gateway. Through such a connection variables can be get and set in R from Python, and also R-functions can be called remotely.  In contrast to `rpy or rpy2 <http://rpy.sourceforge.net/>`_ the R process does not have to run on the same machine, it can run on a remote machine and all variable  access and function calls will be delegated there through the network.

Furthermore - and this makes everything feel very pythonic - all data structures will automatically be converted from native 
R to native Python types and back.
